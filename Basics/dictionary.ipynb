    "# A dictionary in Python is a collection of data that stores items in key-value pairs. Unlike lists (which use indices to access elements), dictionaries use keys to look up their associated values. Think of it like a real-world dictionary: you look up a word (the key), and it gives you the definition (the value).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Characteristics:\n",
    "# Unordered: Before Python 3.7, dictionaries didn’t maintain order. Since Python 3.7, they do preserve insertion order, but you don’t access elements by position like a list.\n",
    "# Mutable: You can change, add, or remove items after creating a dictionary.\n",
    "# Unique Keys: Keys must be unique within a dictionary. If you add a duplicate key, it overwrites the previous value.\n",
    "# Keys are Immutable: Keys can be strings, numbers, tuples, etc., but they must be immutable (e.g., no lists as keys).\n",
    "# Values are Flexible: Values can be anything—numbers, strings, lists, even other dictionaries."
